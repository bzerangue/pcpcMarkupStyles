### NOTES

**Some things to note:**  
Instead of heyday's stickyfooter, I ended up using this very short and sweet plugin: [http://www.drupalcoder.com/blog/cross-browser-sticky-footer-with-fluid-height-using-jquery](http://www.drupalcoder.com/blog/cross-browser-sticky-footer-with-fluid-height-using-jquery) simply worked out of the box, whereas the other one was reluctant. 
The Index Page has the works in terms of masthead and footer, but to keep things concise and readable in the layout files, I only included the essentials. 

Speaking of layouts, they're probably all pretty familiar to you by now, but here's a list for your convenience:

- Home Page

- Article Layouts:
  - Title, Lead Paragraph, Body
  - Title, Lead Paragraph, Body, Video
  - Title, Lead Paragraph, Body, Audio
  - Hero Image, Title, Lead Paragraph, Body
  - Title, Lead Paragraph, Slats

- Large Menu Layouts:
  - Title, Lead Paragraph, Text List Items
  - Title, Lead Paragraph, Image List Items  
    *These can be easily combined, as illustrated in the (currently rough) Use Guide.*

**Other Components:**  

- Orbits: Welcome Orbit, Featured Orbit
- Slats: Event Items, Article Items
- Info Panel: Designed to highlight Media (Latest Sermon) 
- Video: mediaelement.js
- Audio: mediaelement.js

I've left descriptive comments for every section and hope to bring more clarity with the Use Guide. If anything is unclear, please make a note of it so we can make it better.
